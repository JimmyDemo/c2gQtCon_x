        "description": "Over time, the KDE community has seen many people join and leave, as with any opensource community, which means that very few people in the current community still know about the initial culture. Many of the mantras and jokes from the very old days didn&#x27;t make it to these days, and this presentation is an attempt at sharing more of the initial KDE culture to the current generation.  Beyond the possibly surprising way that development was done at the time (for instance, do you know what was used before subversion? CVS. And before CVS?), it is particularly interesting to realize that many of the things in the architecture that we consider fixed and unchanging now, were subject to a much greater amount creativity back then. Maybe this presentation will encourage the current community to be creative again in these areas?  Happy 20 years, KDE ! ",

Finally, we will touch on the Qt Automotive Suite, what it is and how it unleashes the potential of modern software development for automotive.

When complexity grows, it can make sense to move some parts of the implementation to C++, using QObject subclasses with Q_INVOKABLE and Q_PROPERTY macros to interface to QML code. That can work well, particularly when the lifetime of those QObjects is compatible with QML object lifetimes. In this scenario, the C++ QObjects have a role of Model or ViewModel, in an MVVM design.  However, when the Model in the design does not use Qt, or when the lifetime or ownership concepts used for Model objects don&#x27;t correspond well to QML ownership semantics, things get more complex.

At that moment we already had a number of rich web applications based on UI library speaking our design language. It was a natural choice to adapt this interface for desktop application.  We combined the best of both worlds: core business logic written in C++ works stable and fast, UI in HTML/JS gives aesthetic pleasure. And Qt Framework not only provides lots of useful primitives for C++ coding, but also effectively glues both parts together.  However, it requires a responsible team to achieve high quality level and smooth experience on all operating systems.  I will show how we develop, build, maintain and support this application and discuss pros and cons of chosen approach. I will share best practices we use to release fast and error free.",

        "description": "When the talking automated testing, there are different schools for web applications and for native applications:  For web applications it is convenient and well established to use tools like the Selenium suite that allows a script to introspect and manipulate the DOM of a web application directly in a web browser. The test script can “click” buttons, “enter” text and verify the existence and traits of DOM elements. Combined with a back-end introspection, this allows end-to-end testing of a web application. For native Qt applications the established methodology is to build an executable that is linked against the QtTest framework together with a test class that can introspect and manipulate widgets.  But! When developing hybrid applications, there are no framework that can take you all the way from an executable using the QtTest and a test class to the DOM in the embedded web part and back to verification in the test class again. That is why we, at Atlassian, made a hybrid framework for testing hybrid applications.  Our framework allow a programmer to implement classic QtTest tests using a Selenium like API to test the hybrid part of any application (that implements the accessibility interface)  Take-aways:  1: This talk will give the audience a complete walk through of the code used to test the web part of your application from your C++ code using methodologies familiar from the web world.  2: The audience will get a full demonstration of an implementation of a wire protocol server.

Afterwards, you will know how to use perf to find CPU hotspots in your code as well as some tricks to profile wait times for lock contention issues or disk I/O.",

While perf is powerful, it is also quite complex and hard to master: Currently, it consists of more than twenty tools,  most of which often require custom configuration to get conclusive results. Thus, newcomers have a hard time overcoming the steep learning curve.  This talk aims at shortcutting this process by  lying the foundation for any user-space developer to get started with Linux perf. We will cover the basic ways to profile CPU hotspots and dive into some more involved tricks to investigate lock contention or latency issues. Finally, an introduction to custom profiling and data evaluation with Python scripting will be given.  While most parts of this talk will be interesting to any user-space developer on Linux, we will also cover some parts where Linux perf and  Qt work particularly well together.",

Very often they are simply not used while funds are available. At the beginning of the session where, how and also the question why to fundraise money for an OS project will be discussed and further underlined with a few detailed best practice examples also out of my personal experience. Besides, I will exactly show how to apply for different subsidies and explain why simultaneous usage of different fund types is the best strategy to achieve the maximum outcome. By deep diving into different levels of fundings (EU, national and digital) which I have made good experience with, I will show how to gain access to them. I will list advantages and disadvantages of each type of funding in order to better sort out what is the best applicable strategy in which case (like indicating the time efforts for the application, the possible legal implications as well as the amount of money you can achieve with what type of funding) – no matter if it is for an NGO, a registered society, an SME or a single private person. In particular I will differentiate between local / public funds, national and internationals subsidies like European Union fundings and also present diverse and easy accessible online funding possibilities. Currently crowdfunding (even open source crowded platforms; e.g. catarse.me) has proven to be one of the most successful methods to gain resources of any kinds. Also, I will share what precisely needs to be done to receive money by using the following examples:      How to get an online crowd funding     How to constructively use local funds     How to apply for European subsidies   So, in a nutshell, my presentation ideally serves not only as a source of information but also as common motivation and call-to-action to make more use of the existing money pots by addressing the questions where, how and also why to apply for funds and all means of support. ",
        "description": "The inspiring idea behind OS and its efficient use of IT resources as a ground principle makes it quite simple to raise fundings for this field if one is ready to cross the boundaries between technical and entrepreneurial thinking. Nonetheless, to think about fundraising is often one the last steps when new projects are started (especially in the non-profitable sector) but it definitely pays off to take a closer look at it already at an earlier stage of a project phase. 2014 the European Union planned 1 Mio Euro for promotion of Open Source software and currently implements further measurements to strengthen its development. Also on municipal level administrations began to disentangle from proprietary software and to support an open and free environment, slowly but finally understanding its benefits. More pots of money and increasingly higher ones are and will be provided due to its sustainable structure in terms of maintenance and cost efficiency. Since this has become more evident in the last years, this is now also reflected in terms of monetary support and fund grants in general. In addition to that, diverse possibilities in terms of online funding and crowd funding platforms were created that further support and spread OS projects by supporting their resource situation in various ways. Still lot of organizations, projects or SMEs are struggling to make use of this development due to various reasons but mostly because it is unclear where and how to raise funds or because the question why this can be such a beneficial approach is not fully answered. I try to pick that up and answer these by giving various details out of my experience. From my experience I found multi-source funded projects always to be the most successful ones. Using different sources for different aspects turned out to be the most efficient way especially for long-term projects. I will for instance show how an NGO for IT and OS projects in Nigeria survived for 12 years (being independent!) only by using creative funding strategies and what outcomes were possible with these. On the other hand, in certain cases, IT or Software SMEs can generate up to 40% or more of their yearly turnover from diverse fundings, also an interesting fact to pass on. I will share these examples in order to motivate people to turn more open source projects into practice. Funds are not only monetary sources but can also increase general and public attention and thus awareness, which can be highly efficient on the long-term as well. ",

When Stefan Richter started his company freiheit.com technologies in 1999, people in large corporations said: “This Linux thing. Nobody will ever use it here”. Steve Ballmer, then CEO of Microsoft called it “communism”. Now even Microsoft does “open source” - as it is still called by the unenlightened. The world kept on changing and today - as we all are sure that the internet won’t go away - everybody knows that companies need software for their digital transformations. Free Software is now the default option in all large digitalization projects and internet companies. Google, Amazon and Facebook - none of them would exist today, without free software. Stefan will give us a glimpse into the large projects he is doing today from his customers-list that reads like the Who’s Who of the German and European businesses and industry. Why are enterprises like METRO interested in free software? What are the current trends and why and how are larger corporations using free software as their default choice? This talk will help business people to create their own argumentation on how and why to “sell” the idea of using free software in projects to upper management, by showing real-life cases from the last 20 years in the business. And the same time, it will show programmers how much power they actually have to guide these decisions. ",

It is useful and allows us software engineers to create more complex, but also more robust applications than ever. We have come on a good way.  Still, these techniques also cause us headaches and sleepless nights: In every other project we run into situations where seemingly trivial actions and transitions cause our programs to struggle.  Properties change in creative ways, get modified in seemingly random order, take unexpected values. Warnings about null pointers and binding loops occur. Widgets appear in the wrong order, start jumping, or don&#x27;t animate at all. Of course we never can reproduce these issues on our developer machines.  Many of these way-too-familiar problems boil down to the same thing: Lack of control, lack of thought when emitting notifications. This talk will present a selection of problems KDAB engineers identified in real-world C++, Qt Quick and network-driven applications. We will investigate them, present common solutions and compare them to best practice. We will start with obvious approaches like signal blocking and its pitfalls. We will move on to implementation of atomic changes and transactions with Qt. This discussion will naturally take us to the question and advice on when to move model objects from QML to C++.

The use of the Qt features through PyQt was extremely limited, resulting in a very slow and uneffective application.

The new version was primarily aimed to gaining a significantly improved speed and efficiency, real-time reactivity and flexibility, in addition to an easy-to-maintain and easy-to-use application set of packages.  Redesigning the application architecture involved the streamlining and reduction of the Python portion of the application, thus managing only the higher level tasks on a model-view-controller application approach based on the company needs.

The underlying concept is that the shaders should use physical principles in the encoded models - chief of which are conservation of energy and the Fresnel effect.  PBR is used in many AAA game titles but here we will show how to make use of it with Qt 3D as it is widely applicable to many other types of 3D content such as for use within engineering and visualization.  In this talk we will cover how to go take your raw 3D meshes, look at how to prepare textures suitable for use with a PBR-based workflow and how to feed these into a Qt 3D application. Along the way, we will explain how Physics Based Rendering works and how its formulation helps convince the brain of its realism without destroying performance.  We will also take a look at some techniques that are often used in conjunction with PBR such as ambient occlusion and parallax mapping. Time permitting we will look briefly at how to add some post-processing effects to your Qt 3D renderer setup.",
        "description": "Physics Based Rendering is a family of techniques for simulating how light interacts with surfaces. It can be applied in both offline renderers such as path tracers used in the production of television and film VFX, and more importantly for us, in real time rendering systems such as Qt 3D.  There are two main groups of PBR techniques that fall under the Metal-Roughness and Specular-Glossiness workflows. This talk will concentrate on the Metal-Roughness workflow. We will show all the tooling required to take simple 3D meshes, uv-unwrap and export them for use in specialized texturing tools that can then be used to generate the images needed to feed into PBR GLSL shaders.  In addition to the material textures, we will also show how to process HDR environment maps to allow high quality specular reflections to be calculated in real time. The talk will explain how all of these assets work together to produce convincing results. We will also provide tips on reducing the overall memory usage by using modern GPU facilities for managing textures.",

This is why Qt currently belongs to the most modern and versatile UI technologies on the market. QML allows to solve many problems with astonishingly little effort. In some cases however, seemingly small problems can result in big questions. In these situations it’s important to really understand the relevant concepts.  In my session I want to share my experience by presenting reusable techniques that will save a lot of time.  For example: A well organised QML UI project template with outsourced colours, fonts and icons (singleton components / singleton js files). A generic way to handle multiple Z-layers combined with a way to catch click-events outsides the the components own rectangle. Example for handling declarative view interactions using a self-populating menu tree.",

Under this light, it is a fascinating idea to make applications that are already available on the desktop systems also available on phones and tablets and by this reaching a drastically increased number of users. Qt did a lot of groundwork in this direction. Yet, the first steps in this area might be a little bumpy, since the Android world simply “feels” very different from what you are used on your Linux system.  This talk aims to give a fast but accurate introduction into the world of SDKs, NDKs, cross-compilation toolchains, and packaging files. At the end of this talk, a developer shall have an understanding on what is to do to set up an Android cross-compiling environment and how to start developing on their own. Once the basics about how to develop and compile for Android are there, the focus of the talk goes to the libraries and technologies that are available via Qt5 and KF5. In particular, I want to discuss why certain libraries that we love from the desktop world are hard to get on Android to give awareness what the pitfalls are then adapting an application for Android.",

        "description": "Software safety standards like ISO 26262 (road vehicles), EN 50128 (railway applications) an DO-178 C (airborne systems) and others require software developers to ensure software quality through analysis of code coverage achieved through their tests.  Among other measures. This talk will define what this metric means  and - equally important - what it does not mean.  Standard levels measured are statement coverage, branch coverage, decision coverage and the more complex modified/condition decision coverage (MC/DC) or multiple condition coverage (MCC).  We&#x27;ll look at the advantages and drawbacks of these levels and what kind of testing efforts they require.  Qt applications pose several special challenges for measurement of code coverage: first, usage of the Meta Object Compiler (MOC), the User Interface Compiler (UIC) and various macros leads to automatically generated code that can sometimes be hard to fully cover. Secondly, the  language QML includes both static declaration and dynamic JavaScript code.   Above topics will be illustrated through some live demonstrations with different tools. The automated Qt tests will serve as a relatively large real-world example for viewing test coverage. Based on selected spots in the code we&#x27;ll investigate gaps in current QA measures.  Dynamic analysis like code coverage has to be distinguished from static analysis. Nevertheless, some classic static code metrics will be listed as their monitoring is also recommended by the safety standards listed at the beginning.  At the end efforts and benefits of code coverage will be compared with pragmatic recommendations for every day usage.          ",

This is understandable: when they have been created, data almost always resided under users&#x27; control, and the real problem was making sure users have the necessary, freedom-preserving tools to work with it. Today, we use free software tools to deal with data that effectively falls outside of our control. Often we cannot access the data directly, export it, import it somewhere else. Garden walls do not have windows, or very small ones only. Even free software itself is more and more often being developed using walled gardens -- GitHub being one example. And, more and more free software is being used to build walled gardens themselves. As is often the case, there is no easy solution. But there are things we as the free software community can do, within the community itself, and as part of our policy work, to push things in the right direction. This requires added focus on some of the values that seem to have taken the back seat in the free software world: compatibility and interoperability. We need to put &quot;social&quot; back into libre social networks, among others. It is time free software tools became compatible with each other. Good news is, some work is already being done. ",

Indeed, the OpenGL code of your Qt application could have been written before the modernization of the OpenGL API to exploit better GPUs. In this talk, we will walk through a technique to help refactor your old OpenGL code in the safest way possible and get it ready for the 21st century.",
        "description": "We can find plenty of existing OpenGL code in the wild, some of it is rather old. Unfortunately due to the radical changes in GPU architecture, OpenGL had to adapt as well, with more modern, better suited APIs. In turn, it pushed forward very different designs for rendering code.  Because of those technical changes, it can be very challenging to refactor legacy OpenGL code to prepare a port to Modern OpenGL APIs. In particular because such code tends to have close to no automated test coverage. What can we do with all that code? It could be tempting to start from scratch, but there is a clear chance to break the rendering in some subtle ways.  In this live coding session, we&#x27;ll see how we can start from an untested Qt and OpenGL legacy code base, add new features to it, and move it over Modern OpenGL in less than an hour.  It will be a good way to discover how refactoring and pin testing techniques can be used even for your purely graphics code. All of that in a suboptimal codebase and while doing the simplest things that will work.  This talk will be interesting to any developer having to deal with legacy untested OpenGL code or those wanting to modernise for performance or new features. But, if you are interested in testing techniques for rendering code in general or attended one of the previous GildedRose sessions held at Akademy or Qt Dev Days, there will be nice advice for you as well.",

This talk offers a behind the scenes view of the process, and details some of the obstacles we were confronted with on our way and how we overcame them.  Lydia and Thomas also offer some insights into how our vision and mission have affected KDE since their creation, how they have facilitated discussions and streamlined decisions.

        "description": "Software distribution is from a technical point of view has traditionally been a strong-suit of Linux systems. Package managers who are able to tap into huge repositories of Free software have, by their very nature of being Free software, a competitive advantage. Liberal licensing makes it easy for users to install and try software packages. From the user point of view, this choice and its presentation can be a bit overwhelming however. Traditional package managers present huge numbers of packages that don&#x27;t always make sense to the user. Moreover, contribution processes to popular Linux distributions are often too labor-intensive to follow for casual contributors, for some groups, such as artists existing review processes can appear outright unsuitable. The need for a low-barrier system has long been identified, and for a long time, services such as kde-look.org and kde-apps.org have served us quite well. Still, solutions like Apple&#x27;s Appstore or Google Play offer a well-presented way of installing software. They are the baseline we will be measured against, so we have to improve. The full potential of an integrated solution to software installation has never been realized, however, and this is what we&#x27;re trying to offer a plan for, outlined in this talk.  The presentation is suitable for a non-technical audience, especially for people interested in the topic of software distribution and involvement of non-developing contributors.",

        "description": "One of the foundation pillars of Qt Quick 2 is its OpenGL-based rendering pipeline. By leveraging the GPU capabilities, we get 60 frames-per-second animated scenes, real time eye candy and special effects, particles, and so on. Moreover, the main programming language is QML, which is extremely popular amongst developers and designers -- it allows them to quickly prototype and build user interfaces. For these reasons, Qt Quick is becoming the de-facto choice on mobile and embedded platforms.  However, can we integrate Qt Quick 2 with an existing OpenGL codebase? Would it be possible to reuse old, working, tested OpenGL code and give it a new look and feel by building a Qt Quick interface that uses it? How far can we go with that integration?  In this talk, I will show the technologies available in Qt 5.6 that allow deep integration of Qt Quick 2 scenes with custom drawn OpenGL content. We will discuss the possibility of simply providing a Qt Quick overlay for an OpenGL scene. The discussion will then proceed to the creation of custom Qt Quick Items drawn using raw OpenGL commands, which can then be used from QML. Finally, I will illustrate how to manually drive Qt Quick&#x27;s own rendering if we need to be in complete control of how and when the rendering happens.  The audience is expected to have familiarity with basic QtQuick and OpenGL concepts, but no in-depth knowledge of them is required.",

Qt is beginning to enable location awareness in mission-critical systems world-wide, with visualization and mapping services and technologies leading the way. The key ingredient to any successful spatial app built with Qt is a strong, rich and intuitive geoservices API, giving the indispensable value of “the geographic context” to Qt applications and the decision-making process. Information that is analyzed in its geographic context provides deeper meaning to the analytical result. There are many well-known patterns, practices and standards-based approaches to bringing location information to the Qt platform and the broadening of it. Many location API contributors follow these important standards, and Esri is one of these. This paper talks about the critical value of geospatial contributions to the platform through the use of Esri’s ArcGIS Services and API platform, including Esri’s opensource geoservices plugin for Qt. ",

        "abstractText": "Qt Quick and QML provide an easy way to rapidly develop customized, reusable components entirely within QML. As these components grow in complexity, performance and maintainability often suffer, a drawback that is especially noticeable on low-powered embedded and mobile devices. In addition, some specialized components simply cannot be implemented by combining existing Qt Quick items in QML. For these cases, Qt Quick provides access to its underlying OpenGL scene graph via a C++ API. Components created this way are more closely aligned to the  underlying scene graph architecture allowing improved performance and a cleaner implementation.",
        "description": "Qt Quick provides a flexible and easy-to-use framework for developing a wide range of applications from automotive HMIs to interactive desktop applications. Under the hood, it uses an OpenGL scene graph for  rendering, allowing advanced effects and fluid animations even on low-powered systems. Complex components written entirely in QML can cause noticeable performance problems especially on these low-powered  systems. Qt Quick provides a C++ API to directly access its underlying scene graph for creating optimized components with better encapsulation. These components can then be reused from QML in the same way as the built-in Qt Quick items.  The focus of this talk will be describing the steps necessary to create a Qt Quick component using C++ and OpenGL. We will start with a custom component written entirely in QML and point out the performance and  maintenance problems with this approach. We will then reimplement this component in C++ and OpenGL, step-by-step, so that by the end you&#x27;ll know enough to create your own C++ Qt Quick components. Finally we&#x27;ll  compare the resulting component&#x27;s implementation and performance against the original to see the improvement. I will also briefly mention the QtQuickFrameBufferObject as an alternative and discuss when you would use it instead of the scene graph API.  The talk is aimed at developers with minimal OpenGL experience. It will briefly introduce enough of the basic OpenGL concepts to get you started writing a custom Qt Quick item.",

Its very first release occurred as part of KDE Applications 16.04 and already provides a set of 44 exercises regarding ear training.  Minuet relies on extensive use of MIDI capabilities to provide a flexible and powerful environment for music education. Minuet&#x27;s core architecture enables the specification of new exercises as a set of simple JSON files, which are automatically merged and processed in order to build the Minuet&#x27;s UI. For that purpose, we adopt a lot of dynamic QML coding. Current and future work include: the development of a new version devoted to mobile platforms (to be undertaken as a Google Summer of Code 2016 project), support for multiple music instruments, use of singing and claping data (from the computer&#x27;s microphone) as input devices, and a flexible architecture for defining and applying exams.  This talk presents the motivation, design principles, major features and future roadmap for Minuet. I&#x27;ll talk about how Minuet compares with other proprietary and FLOSS software for music education, its current features and how the community is been structured, as well as the goals we expect to achieve regarding its use in other platforms, integration with social media, and pedagogic aspects.",

        "description": "As announced earlier this year, the Qt graphics stack - and first and foremost, Qt Quick - is undergoing the most significant changes since its introduction in Qt 5.0. The aim of the modularization process is to remove the strong OpenGL dependency, paving the way for other graphics APIs in the future, and to strengthen support for environments where accelerated graphics is not feasible.  The previously standalone Qt Quick 2D Renderer is going to become a core part of Qt Quick with a new LGPLv3 license, making it available out of the box on every platform. In addition to a number of internal changes and enhancements, the introduction of partial updates will be visible to every user of this backend since expensive fullscreen updates plaguing earlier releases are now avoided.  To prove that the changed Qt Quick Scenegraph interfaces are suitable to handle graphics APIs different from OpenGL, an additional backend using Direct3D 12 is being developed in parallel with the rest of the changes. This also provides the foundations for potential future support for APIs like Vulkan or Metal.   While OpenGL remains the default, number one choice, and many Qt Quick applications are expected to be able to run on a different backend without changes, there are cases, typically involving custom QQuickItems or shader effects, that will need attention and potentially a few changes from the applications. The first set of the Qt Quick improvements are expected to get integrated into Qt 5.8, due H2/2016. It is now therefore time to take a look at what these changes mean in practice. ",

        "description": "Mapbox GL Native is a recent product released by Mapbox in July, 2015 — a cross-platform framework for responsive maps with focus on mobile. Now developers can have the most detailed maps sourced from ever-updating OpenStreetMap data, as well as the ability to fully control the style and brand to design maps that perfectly match their app. This is all done using our new on-device vector renderer, which uses OpenGL ES 2.0 technology for pixel-perfect map design, from antialiased fonts to polygon blurring, all hardware-accelerated and optimized for mobile devices — and all on the fly.  With the power and flexibility of Qt, enabling its port for Mapbox GL Native was fast and easy. We provide two different Qt APIs - QMapboxGL and QQuickMapboxGL - which solve different problems. The former is a low-level implementation that can be used on previous versions of Qt and is easily integrated into pure C++ environments. The latter takes advantage of Qt Quick’s modern user interface technology, and is the perfect tool for adding navigation maps on embedded platforms. In this talk we&#x27;d like to expose these APIs by going through the features doing a live demo on a Raspberry Pi 3 using Yocto.",

        "description": "In 2009 everything began. I decided to organize a developer sprint for the community I used a lot of my software from. Thus the 3rd edition of a Plasma sprint (called Tokamak back then) was held at the Chalet (holiday house) of my family in Randa, Switzerland. I could welcome around 20 developers and contributors form Serbia to Brazil working on my favorite desktop workspace.  Back then I was cooking myself for this crowd, showed them area and offered them internet connectivity and electricity to work on code. 7 years later I might need to cook again myself as I&#x27;m still searching for a chef but the Meetings grew and we&#x27;re in a different house in the some village.  40 to 60 people meet year by year in the middle of the Swiss Alps. Undistracted in a beautiful surrounding they can concentrate on coding, discussing and finding solutions for difficult IT problems.  But to make these Meetings real I need to spend one to two months per year for preparations, organization, logistics and financial matters. Over the years my family supported me a lot and I found some locale and less-locale helpers outside of KDE that helped me too.  So should one start that big or how many people does a KDE sprint need to have to be a real sprint? And what should one look out for if you want to organize such a meet-up yourself?",

X11 has no security model and many severe security flaws from allowing keyloggers to just take over the complete windowing system. Given the non-existent security on X11, it&#x27;s normal that applications trust applications running as the same user. This is known as &quot;if it runs, it is trusted!&quot; There is no point trying to protect against malware on the same system, it can just talk to X11.  With Wayland we have the chance to create a secure system from a windowing system perspective. The protocol doesn&#x27;t allow key loggers, doesn&#x27;t allow grabbing window content, etc. etc. So one would think that Wayland improves the situation.  Alas that&#x27;s not the case. Installing a key logger on Wayland is still trivial, taking over the complete session is still trivial.  All the problems of X11 are still there, because the system is not secure. Everything is trusted, everything can modify every aspect of the running or the next running session. Fixing this is difficult, it&#x27;s an uphill battle against the mentality of &quot;if it runs, it is trusted&quot;.   In this talk we will look at how bad the security of X11 is and how one can take over a (KWin) Wayland session. We will look at the various efforts in Plasma to fix these problems and to make it more difficult for malware to get into the system.",

The presentation will take the MuseScore desktop software and the MuseScore mobile app as an example.

It is a Qt Widget app with several external dependencies available on Windows, Mac and Linux. MuseScore uses the CMake build system and regressions tests written with QTest and managed by CTest. As a WYSIWYG software, MuseScore also relies on visual tests managed independently.  The presentation will show how the MuseScore project uses Travis-CI to build and run the tests for every push but also every pull requests made to the project. It will also show how Travis-CI is used to deliver self contained binaries for Linux (AppImage) on x86_64, x86 and ARM on Bintray.com and also a DMG package for MacOS on a public FTP server. For Windows builds, our use of AppVeyor will be presented. The discussion will introduce the challenges of building automatically a large desktop app in a relatively constrained environment without any UI.  MuseScore also provides a mobile app for iOS and Android. The app is in Qt/QML and built with qmake. We will show how a new version of the app is sent to testers for every build and how the app is cross compiled, automatically tested and, deployed on both Google Play and the Apple App Store together with metadata and screenshots translated in several languages. We will discuss the different problems which had to be solved in order to have a fully automated distribution chain.  We hope that sharing our experience with other Qt developers will help to generalize continuous tests and distributions among the Qt community and then develop best practices to solve common problems.",

However, multinational companies ask for their users’ data and contributions to advance their own business interests, to improve their products or to enhance their services. However, they regard their users’ contribution as their property without any obligation to share these contributions under an open license. ",
        "description": "Android, the world’s leading mobile operating system, is Free Software; however, Google integrates its own non-free features so deeply into Android that ordinary users cannot use Android as Free Software and they are tied up with Google, using Google services and thus contributing with their data to enhance Google’s business interest. There are different world views and anthropological and socio-economic concepts behind the idea of sharing. Augustine of Hippo makes sharing a virtue: „Omnis enim res, quae dando non deficit, dum habetur et non datur, nondum habetur, quomodo habenda est”, („For if a thing is not diminished by being shared with others, it is not rightly owned if it is only owned and not shared”) which is also the FSFE’s motto. According to Augustine, man – by the grace of God - is capable of doing good and contribute to the well-being of society. A similar anthropology is also found within Pietism and Puritanism, according to the American Sociologist Robert Merton, „communalism” - a concept favoring communal ownership and the common good – being a basis for the scientific progress as scientific discoveries are shared and not kept exclusively to oneself. In the history of ideas, this mindset resembles the principles of Open Access and Open Data. Open Source Software or Free Software can also be based on the same principles, following the underlying anthropological concepts. In contrast, Thomas Hobbes’s assumption – as laid out in the claim „homo homini lupus” („man is wolf to man.”) - assumes that egotism is a driving force, „bellum omnium contra omnes” („the war of all against all”) is a constant in human society. Adam Smith – in „The Wealth of Nations” makes man’s self-interest the basis for his socio-economic concept: „By pursuing his own interest he [=man] frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.” While everybody is pursuing their own interest, an „invisible hand” - so Smith’s assumption - leads all self-driven interests to ultimately promoting the common good, thus making Liberalism (and Capitalism) the best economic models for society. If egotism is the driving anthropological force and Capitalism is the socio-economic model for society, then hiding code from others, accumulating data and keeping databases locked up, producing software whose data cannot be exported, is the logical consequence. Google, Facebook, Microsoft are symbols of this concept, advancing the company’s profits with their users’ contributions. On the other hand, if sharing is understood in the way of communalism, Free Software – and Open Access, and Open Data, can be the foundation of a socio-economic model for the Information Society that correlates with Augustine’s anthropology.

        "description": "In previous versions of QtQuick, we had a few Items specialized for handling pointing device events, such as MouseArea, Flickable, PinchArea, and MultiPointTouchArea.  Some of them are limited to handling mouse events, so when you use a touchscreen, they rely on receiving synthesized mouse events.  This precludes touch interaction with multiple Items, because of the assumption that there is only one mouse - despite the fact that you are using a multi-touch screen.  At the 2015 Qt Contributors&#x27; Summit, we discussed a potential solution to the problem, from which the present implementation has evolved.  The solution is to have one type of event (a synthetic wrapper in Qt 5, and a common base class in Qt 6) for all pointing-device events, and a new larger set of lightweight Handler objects,  focused purely on handling events.  They can be device-agnostic, or can filter events from specific kinds of devices.  They are not Items themselves, but pointer-handling aspects of Items.  This talk will be an exploration of these Handlers and their use cases: how to achieve fluid, multiple-touch, multiple-user UIs in Qt Quick.",

However, a large part of today&#x27;s computer-aided research is performed with non-free software. In academia there is an additional dimension to the usage of non-free software aside from the issues commonly associated with it. Traditional academic norms include the concept of communality — i.e. sharing so that others may build upon your findings — which in most interpretations implies free software. However, situating software in academia in the broader context of present academic cultures reveals considerable drift from these traditional academic norms. This talk examines reasons for the prevalence of non-free software in research and highlights differences between some disciplines. Particular focus lies on strategies to be adapted from those disciplines that favour free software. A free software working group at a local university serve as case study of how free software may be practically established in public institutions.  ",
        "description": "This talk does not deal with arbitrary software used in academic institutions but only with software which is involved in the actual act of research. It does not discuss technical attributes of any piece of software but tries to uncover the mechanisms of software usage and software production in academic research. By doing so it presents the underlying political and ethical issue in academia, nowadays discussed under the label open research: Is it necessary to release the software used for research in order to be a good researcher? If so, is this only necessary so others can reproduce your results or is there a moral implication to release this software under a free license so others can reuse and adapt it? In this talk I would like to show some steps how to establish free software in academic institution, pitfalls to look out for and arguments to be ready to counter. Most of these insights I take from personal experience in a number of academic fields which are very diverse regarding the attitude towards free software. However, there are many aspects readily applicable not only to academia but also to other types of institution. I will also discuss likely future actions of distributors of non-free software which target academic institutions and how to be ready for them. By studying actions that we took in the local working group and their results one might see that some high-impact goals can be fairly easy to reach. This is greatly helped by a general willingness to be &quot;open&quot; in academia, as reflected in the open research movement or the open access movement. However, there are some actors involved in academia who are only interested in the positive image connected with the &quot;open&quot; label. In this talk, I will try to present some aspects of this &quot;openwashing&quot; and how it relates to free software. ",

        "description": "Most computer programs read and write files. Usually, the translation from bytes in the file to information in the program is coded by hand.  For live communications between programs the situation is better. On the desktop, DBus is most well known example of a protocol with automatic (de)serialization. And for XML files there is XMl Schema and Relax NG. Yet, there is no widely used method for generating code for reading arbitrary binary files and text files.  MSOScheme is a library that translates a description of binary Microsoft Office files into C++ and Java code. It is used in Calligra to translate these files into OpenDocument Format. Binary Microsoft Office files are extremely complex, but using the generated code is easy and safe.  The Data Format Description Language (DFDL) is an open specification to describe file formats.  New data formats are created every day and new programming languages come into being quickly. It is not feasible to write (de)serialization code for all formats in each language. It is better to generate code from a description of the file format.  In this presentation, I&#x27;ll explain how this works from simple examples.",

        "description": "A Free Software community or project can be seen as a movement, or as an organization which creates products.  From a product-focused perspective, a community or project is not defined by what its members want, but by what it creates, and what benefits that product brings to its users. A product is only worth creating if it brings value to a relevant group of users, and every aspect of it is measured by that criterion. A product-focused project makes sure that it collects actionable feedback from its users and keeps the quality and attractiveness of its product high.  From a movement perspective, several project groups  together form a movement, which is defined by its overarching goal. The actions of every group are defined and measured by their contribution to that goal. The overarching goal is usually not realistically achievable, but it is what keeps the movement going. It is broken down into multiple, achievable short- and mid-term sub-goals. A movement-focused mindset makes sure that the different groups within a movement work together to achieve their common goal.  Both mindsets can bring benefits to a Free Software community: The movement-focused mindset keeps its motivation up and its actions coherent, whereas the product-focused mindset ensures that the product&#x27;s quality and value to its users is not forgotten. Ideally, it should switch between both, depending on the question at hand.",

We will discuss how threads, QObjects and events interact together; how a thread affinity of a QObject has a play in signals and slots connections; and how you can leverage the modern C++11 threading capabilities in your Qt application.",
        "description": "Cross-platform thread support was introduced in Qt 2.2, released in 2000, ages before it finally got standardized by C++11. This support has allowed developers using Qt to succesfully build countless multithreaded applications, running natively on many operating systems: Windows, Linux, OS X, QNX, iO S, Android, and so on.  Across the span of four major versions Qt&#x27;s threading facilities have been greatly expanded and improved. Following Qt&#x27;s evolution across the years, a number of &quot;design patterns&quot; have emerged, in order to allow developers to use these facilities to the maximum extent, and not fall into any of the countless traps of multithreaded programming.  In this talk I will discuss the basics of thread support in Qt, starting from QThread, the central class in Qt that manages a thread. I will then focus on the interactions between QObjects, QThreads and thread-local event loops, and how all of this plays a role into the cross-thread signals and slots. The most common pitfalls will be analyzed and discussed here.  I will then show how to &quot;mix and match&quot; Qt and C++11/14 threading and synchronization primitives, and what degree of support one can expect when moving away from Qt&#x27;s constructs in favour of the standard C++ ones.

        "description": "State Chart XML (SCXML) is a common format to specify state machines. It has been standardized by the W3C and there are many applications that produce or process it. State charts provide a graphical way of modeling how a system reacts to stimuli. This is done by defining the possible states that the system can be in, and how the system can move from one state to another. State charts offer a very concise representation of business logic, and limit the potential for unexpected behavior.  Qt 5.7 comes with a technical preview of Qt SCXML, a module to integrate state charts specified in SCXML into your application, and execute them in accordance to the W3C specification. This way a Qt application can be driven from a state chart, rather than from business logic expressed in C++ or QML.  With Qt SCXML, SCXML documents can be compiled into C++, which can then be readily integrated into any Qt application. Alternately, SCXML documents can also be dynamically loaded and interpreted at run time. In both cases, states are exposed via Qt properties, so that QML properties can effortlessly be bound to them. It is thus very easy to attach a Qt Quick UI to an existing, or newly written, state machine.  The talk will show the full workflow of creating a state machine in a visual design tool, integrating it into a project with Qt Creator, adding a custom data model, and attaching a user interface to it, using QML and Qt Quick.",

        "description": "KDE provides a lot of free software. If you run this yourself you enjoy all the benefits of free software, the freedoms to use, study, share, and improve the software. You are in control of your digital life.  The situation is different when using software which is run by others as a service, even if these others run free software. There you don&#x27;t have control about what software is run and how. What does that mean for your freedoms? How much control do you still have? Do you know what is happening to your data? Do you have the freedom to switch to a different service? How is your own freedom affecting the freedom of other users of the same service? There are a lot of questions like these.  There are a couple of approaches how to address these questions. There are the user data manifesto [1], the &quot;Terms of Service; Didn&#x27;t Read&quot; site [2], the GNU ethical repository criteria [3], and other attempts at covering specific aspects of freedom of web services. But there is no definition yet what makes a web service free as in freedom, which is as concise and elegant as the free software definition is.  This presentation will give an overview of where we are, what approaches to defining the freedom of web services exist, and what is missing. It&#x27;s intended to start a discussion which leads to a definition of what a web service has to provide to give users the same freedom as they have when running free software themselves. This is the beginning of a journey and everybody who cares about freedom is invited to join.

It is wonderful to be a women and women should have equal rights to man - be it social, political, economic, or cultural. But, If we look at the percentage of women participation in any field, be it tech or any other field, ratio is damn poor. We, being in the eligible category to guide other women to open source culture, should take steps forward to make this ratio better. I know, taking an initiative in this man dominant area is not easy. But together, we can and we will make the difference. Every tiny little step counts, like educating poor female children, reaching out to college girls to spread knowledge and opportunities about open source, educating them about Ada Initiative, the GNOME Project’s Outreach Program for Women, OpenHatch, Women in Drupal and other similar projects. There are so many nice outreach programs for women in open source, we just need to spread the knowledge and motivate every women out there to join the movement. There are lots of things to do, not just coding and developing, everybody can find other exciting things to do in open source projects i.e. writing, documentation, designing, translation, testing etc. Every established women in open source should feel &quot;obligated&quot; to educate/ help/ motivate at least two other women in her life span to join open source community and make this open source culture more lovable and beautiful and little more feminist.

It spans from mathematical to language to science and mouse coordination and many more..  Some of the activities are game orientated, but nonetheless still educational.  The topics of discussion under talks and main points with descriptions are: ==================================================== Architecture of GCompris (https://github.com/bdoin/GCompris-qt.git)  1. A C++ core in src/core 2. QML activities in src/activities/* 3. Each activity in its folder 4. An activity can extend an other one and provide it a dataset 5. At compilation time each activity is zipped in a ‘rcc’ file which is loaded at run time.  ==================================================== How  to contribute GCompris and how is it made of?  1. Codebase  ------Activity Development   2.Compilation chain in CMake  3.Core Development (This is where the whole talk will be concentrated) ------Activity API ------C++ Widgets ------QML Widgets  4.

In most cases, the right questions at the right time decide over success or failure of a project. My session will give insights into proved and tested processes for successful UI projects. Additionally, I promote a better understanding of the need for very close collaboration between developers and designers. The goal is to encourage the developers to discuss questions with designers instead of simply implementing the next best solution. ",

Ever since the emergence of QML, Qt meets the requirements for developing pixel perfect custom UIs with ease. It is not only a question of programming skills, though. To collaborate efficiently, designers and developers need to speak the same language. Otherwise it is almost impossible to implement a UI true to the vision the designer created. In my session, I want to reduce reservations between the two “peoples” designers and developers and encourage the mutual understanding. In most cases, the right questions at the right time decide over success or failure of a project.

        "abstractText": "Much of the fight for free software has been about ensuring that users of software retain their freedom to tinker. In the meantime, the importance of software has grown beyond the scope of user rights. There are other, public interests in having source code available. The three most pressing reasons in addition to user freedoms are:      Source code availability as an accountability mechanism that potentially substitutes strict liabilities     Source code availability for purposes of government accountability in a democratic society     Source code availability for purposes of data protection to prevent discrimination   This is a potentially slightly political topic with a somewhat longer term perspective than the most pressing issues of today. That said, there is an advocacy element to it as well, I do not believe that most of the user freedoms arguments do resonate that strongly with (organisation) users of software since they do not always recognise the extent to which computer software touches the core of their functions and what source availability means for that, especially in the public sector. I have held a version of this talk before, at the LLW workshop in Barcelona in April 2016 and this would be more geared towards developers than to lawyers. ",
